## Presentation Outline

### Slide 1: Title Slide (30 seconds)

**Title**: Automated Resilience Testing: A Cloud-Native Chaos Engineering Platform

**Subtitle**: Proactively Testing Fault Tolerance in AWS

**Presenter**: Aravind S

**Key Visual**: Architecture diagram showing the complete platform

### Slide 2: The Problem (2 minutes)

**Title**: Why Chaos Engineering?

**Key Points**:
- Modern cloud applications are designed to be resilient
- Redundancy, auto-scaling, multi-AZ deployments are common
- But... are these features actually tested?
- Most organizations discover their recovery doesn't work during real outages

**Real-World Example**:
> "Our application has Auto Scaling... but we've never actually tested if it works when an instance fails"

**The Question**:
> Does our application survive when a core component unexpectedly fails?

**Visuals**:
- Graph showing typical outage discovery timeline
- Quote from Netflix about chaos engineering origins

### Slide 3: The Solution (2 minutes)

**Title**: Automated Chaos Engineering Platform

**What It Does**:
1. ✅ Automatically selects a healthy instance
2. ✅ Terminates it (controlled failure injection)
3. ✅ Monitors system recovery
4. ✅ Reports success or failure
5. ✅ Can run on a schedule or on-demand

**Key Benefits**:
- **Proactive**: Find issues before customers do
- **Automated**: No manual intervention required
- **Safe**: Multiple safety layers prevent accidents
- **Cost-Effective**: <$1 per experiment
- **Continuous**: Can run daily/weekly automatically

**Visual**: Before/After comparison
- Before: "Hope it works" → After: "Proven resilience"

### Slide 5: Safety Features (2 minutes)

**Title**: Safety-First Design

**Multi-Layer Protection**:

1. **Tag-Based Targeting**
   - Only instances tagged with `ChaosTarget=true`
   - IAM policies enforce this at AWS API level

2. **Pre-Experiment Validation**
   - Checks system is healthy first
   - Aborts if already unhealthy

3. **Dry Run Mode**
   - Test without actually terminating
   - Validate permissions and targeting

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Every action logged to CloudWatch
   - Full audit trail

**Quote**:
> "We can be confident we're only affecting test instances, never production"

### Slide 6: The Experiment Workflow (3 minutes)

**Title**: How a Chaos Experiment Works

**Step-by-Step**:

**1. Pre-Experiment Health Check** ✓
- Query CloudWatch metrics
- Check healthy host count
- Verify no existing errors
- **Decision**: Healthy? → Continue | Unhealthy? → Abort

**2. Select Target Instance** 🎯
- List all instances in Auto Scaling Group
- Filter for healthy, InService instances
- Filter for ChaosTarget=true tag
- Randomly select one

**3. Inject Failure** ⚡
- Terminate the selected instance
- Log the action
- **The chaos begins!**

**4. Wait for Recovery** ⏱
- Wait 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- Auto Scaling detects failure
- Launches replacement instance
- Load Balancer health checks pass

**5. Post-Experiment Health Check** 🔍
- Query CloudWatch metrics again
- Verify healthy host count restored
- Check for error spikes
- **Decision**: Recovered? → Success | Not recovered? → Failure

**6. Report Results** 📊
- Log detailed outcome
- Mark experiment as SUCCESS or FAIL

## Live Demo Script (5-10 minutes)

### Demo Setup

**Prerequisites** (Set up before presentation):
1. All infrastructure deployed
2. AWS Console open in browser (Step Functions page)
3. Terminal ready with scripts
4. Application URL bookmarked

### Demo Flow

#### Part 1: Show the Target Application (1 minute)

**Script**:
> "First, let's look at what we're testing. This is a simple web application running on AWS."

**Actions**:
1. Open application URL in browser
2. Refresh a few times
3. Point out the instance ID changes (load balancing)

**Talk Points**:
- "Notice the instance ID - this tells us which server is handling our request"
- "The application is running on 2 instances across 2 availability zones"
- "Let's verify it's healthy before we break it"

#### Part 2: Pre-Experiment Validation (1 minute)

**Script**:
> "Before we inject chaos, we always validate the system is healthy."

**Actions**:
```bash
./scripts/test-lambda-functions.sh validate-health
```

**Talk Points**:
- "This calls our validate-health Lambda function"
- "It checks CloudWatch metrics: healthy host count, error rates, response time"
- "Status: PASS - system is healthy"

#### Part 3: Run the Chaos Experiment (4 minutes)

**Script**:
> "Now let's run a chaos experiment. This will terminate one of our instances and see if the system recovers."

**Actions**:
```bash
./scripts/run-chaos-experiment.sh
```

**Talk Points during execution**:

1. **When confirmation prompt appears**:
   > "Notice the safety check - it asks for confirmation and shows what will happen"

2. **As experiment starts**:
   > "The experiment has started. Let's watch the Step Functions console to see the workflow"

3. **Switch to AWS Console** (Step Functions execution page):
   - Point out the visual workflow
   - Show current state
   - "Here you can see each step in the experiment"

4. **Back to terminal**:
   > "The script is monitoring execution in real-time"

5. **While waiting** (explain states):
   - "Pre-health check: PASSED"
   - "Selected instance: [ID]"
   - "Terminated the instance"
   - "Now waiting 180 seconds for Auto Scaling to recover"

6. **Optional - Show application**:
   - Refresh application URL
   - "Notice it's still working - the load balancer redirected traffic to the healthy instance"

7. **When complete**:
   > "Post-health check: PASSED - system recovered!"

#### Part 4: Show Results (2 minutes)

**Script**:
> "Let's examine what happened."

**Actions**:

1. **Show terminal output**:
   - Point out SUCCESS status
   - Show terminated instance ID
   - Health check summaries

2. **AWS Console - Step Functions**:
   - Show execution details
   - Click through states to show input/output
   - Point out logging

3. **AWS Console - EC2 Auto Scaling**:
   - Show instance list
   - Point out new instance (different ID)
   - "Auto Scaling detected the failure and launched a replacement"

4. **Application still works**:
   - Refresh application URL
   - "Application remained available throughout"

**Talk Points**:
- "The entire process was automated"
- "We validated that Auto Scaling works exactly as designed"
- "The application had zero downtime from the user perspective"

#### Part 5: Wrap Up Demo (1 minute)

**Script**:
> "That's a complete chaos engineering experiment. In less than 5 minutes, we proactively tested our system's resilience and proved it works."

**Show**:
```bash
# Show recent execution history
aws stepfunctions list-executions --state-machine-arn [ARN] --max-items 5
```

**Final Point**:
> "And we can run this on a schedule - daily, weekly, continuously validating our resilience."

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q1: What if the experiment fails?**
A: Great question! The platform reports failure with detailed information about what went wrong. This could indicate:
- Auto Scaling configuration issues
- Health check problems
- Insufficient capacity
The detailed logs help us diagnose and fix the issue.

**Q2: Is it safe to run in production?**
A: With proper setup, yes! The safety features include:
- Tag-based targeting (only affects tagged instances)
- Pre-experiment validation (aborts if unhealthy)
- Multiple IAM safeguards
However, I recommend starting in non-production environments first.

**Q3: How long does an experiment take?**
A: About 3-4 minutes total:
- Pre-check: 10 seconds
- Target selection: 5 seconds
- Failure injection: 5 seconds
- Recovery wait: 180 seconds
- Post-check: 10 seconds

**Q4: Can it test other types of failures?**
A: Currently it tests EC2 instance termination, but the architecture is extensible. Future versions could test:
- Network failures
- Application errors
- Resource exhaustion
- Multi-region failover

**Q5: What's the cost?**
A: Very affordable:
- Infrastructure: ~$44/month (can be much less with optimization)
- Each experiment: $0 (under AWS free tier)
- Can delete resources when not testing to save costs

**Q6: How did you learn AWS Step Functions?**
A: Through this project! Key resources:
- AWS documentation
- Hands-on experimentation
- Trial and error with the state machine
- Understanding Amazon States Language

**Q7: What was the hardest part?**
A: Integration testing. Making sure all components work together:
- CloudFormation stack dependencies
- IAM permission configuration
- Step Functions state machine debugging
- Comprehensive error handling

**Q8: Can it notify teams when experiments fail?**
A: Not currently, but adding SNS notifications would be straightforward:
- Add SNS topic to CloudFormation
- Add notification state to Step Functions
- Send alert on experiment failure
